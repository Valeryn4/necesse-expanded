# Necesse Expanded (v0.6)
Necesse Expanded is an all-in-one mod package, developed by myself, for the open world survival crafting game Necesse, 
which was published by Fair Games ApS. This mod is intended to provide a comprehensive overhaul of the vanilla Necesse
experience, adding new content and mechanics, and updating vanilla content to a higher standard.

Please note that this repository is intended to help other modders understand how to develop their own Necesse mods,
in addition to providing a backup of my work in the event of data loss. Please do not download from this repository
with the expectation that you are accessing a more 'up-to-date' version of the mod, what I publish here is usually
unfinished, and may not work as intended.

The latest working version of this mod can be found at the mod's Steam Workshop page, with over 10,000 downloads!
